# hello-world
Absolute beginner. Wrote Fortran, Pascal, editing scripts in the 1980s, only Windows .bat files since.

I put a huge effort into writing a .bat front-end to terabyteunlimited's image backup & restore app. Ideas kept coming, such as customisable automated image archive depth. It worked a treat. However, TBI released a version with many of these features added, integrated into the program, easier to use & in most ways better than mine. There's the folly of working alone.

I loved programming for the 7 years I did it in the '80s. I'd like to feel that again & perhaps contribute to something worthwhile. Obviously my former skills are irrelevant now. I can learn.
